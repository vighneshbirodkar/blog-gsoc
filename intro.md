Graph Based Image Segmentation
------------------------------

Human vision capabilities have always been far superior as compared to coputer vision. It's kind of expected when you put millions of years of evolution against a few hundred years of human research. Much of this is attributed to out innate ability to distingush objects from one another. We seem to be abe to do it naturally and without any effort.

The task of seperating objects from an image is called segentation.  Given an 2D Image, the segmentation algorithm outputs a labelled image. The labelled image has the same dimensions as the original image. For all pixels in the original image belonging to the same object, the corresponding pixels in the labelled image have a single unique value.
